# soko-test

My first Rust and Piston project, an attempt at creating a Sokoban-style puzzle game in Rust with the [Piston game engine](https://www.piston.rs). 

## Requirements

To Run -- OpenGL v3.2 or better.

## Changelog

- **v0.1.0** -- Windowing and Movement Prototyping  
- **v0.1.1** -- First x64_86-pc-windows binary  
- **v0.2.0** -- *(WIP)* Entity Interactions

## Running With Binary

- Donwload the binary for your system from your chosen release.
- Run the binary, all binaries should run natively.

**Current Dev Focus:** *x64_86-pc-windows*

## Running Without Binary

**Requires both Rust and the Cargo package manager.**

```bash
cargo run
```
